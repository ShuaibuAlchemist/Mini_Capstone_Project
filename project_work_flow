**Project Workflow**

1. Project Planning and Scope
Objective: Determine if whale transactions (>$100K) correlate with or precede price movements of a selected token (e.g., ETH, BTC, or a DeFi token).

Key Questions:

Do spikes in whale activity align with or predict price volatility?

Is there a pattern between transfer volume and price movement direction?

2. Data Source Integration
A. Price Data â€” Coingecko API
Goal: Collect hourly or daily historical price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Steps:

Use https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/{id}/market_chart

Params: vs_currency (e.g., USD), days, interval (hourly/daily)

Format as a time-indexed DataFrame

B. Whale Activity â€” Dune Sim API
Goal: Extract on-chain large transfers (> $100K).

Steps:

Query Dune using a simulation API or pre-built dashboards with large transfer filters.

Key fields: timestamp, value (in USD or token), sender, receiver, tx hash

Filter for transfer events > $100,000

Resample/group by hour or day

3. Data Wrangling (with Pandas)
Merge datasets on timestamp (hour/day)

Feature Engineering:

Normalize whale transfer count or volume

Compute daily/hourly price change % or price volatility

Create flags for "whale spike" periods (e.g., >95th percentile activity)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly:

Time series plots of:

Whale activity vs price

Overlay whale transfer volume with price chart

Scatterplots:

Whale volume vs % price change

Histograms/boxplots:

Distribution of price changes after whale spikes

Rolling window analysis:

Rolling correlation between whale activity and price movement

5. Statistical Analysis & Modeling (Optional Extension)
Lag correlation analysis:

Cross-correlation function (CCF) to check if whale activity leads price moves

Granger causality test:

Check if past whale activity helps predict future price

Anomaly detection:

Identify outliers in whale activity and price behavior

Regression models (optional):

Linear/logistic regression to quantify relationships

6. Insights & Interpretation
Key findings:

Is there a noticeable pattern?

What time lag (if any) seems most predictive?

Limitations:

Data granularity, whale behavior assumptions, off-chain activity

7. Visualization Dashboard (Optional Extension)
Tools: Plotly Dash, Streamlit, or Jupyter Notebook presentation

Features:

Token selector

Whale activity overlay on price chart

Interactive time window slider

8. Reporting
Documentation:

Data sources, methods, assumptions

Notebook or PDF Report:

Problem statement, analysis, visualizations, conclusions
